  /*
      Unchanged is a no-operation, tells TR that some road part or section stays intact but it needs
        to be included in the message for other changes
      New is a road address placing to a road that did not have road address before
      Transfer is an adjustment of a road address, such as extending a road 100 meters from the start:
        all the addresses on the first part are transferred with +100 to each start and end address M values.
      ReNumeration is a change in road addressing but no physical or length changes. A road part gets a new
        road and/or road part number.
      Termination is for ending a road address (and possibly assigning the previously used road address
        to a new physical location at the same time)
